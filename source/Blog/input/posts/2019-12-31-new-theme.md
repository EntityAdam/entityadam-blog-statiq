In preparation for 2020 and ideally a slew of new articles, I've finally wired up a decent theme to this blog site.  I don't particularly enjoy front end work so it takes me a while to get a round tuit. I'm using the 'clean-bulma-theme' and it covers all the bases and looks nice.

It took quite a bit of fumbling to get it to work since I know nothing about Ruby and I haven't messed with the blog in many months so I needed a refresher on how to Jekyll. It appears it has a way to toss in Disqus as well and so if I have any angry readers yet, you'll be able to comment soon :)
