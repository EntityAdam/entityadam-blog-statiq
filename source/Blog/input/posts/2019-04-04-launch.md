Welcome to my blog! It took me a while to find a low-overhead blog solution, but I believe this setup is what I'm finally going to go with.

 - The site is statically generated by Jekyll.
 - It is stored on Azure Blob Storage.
 - It is served through Azure Content Delivery Network.
 - The Jekyll build and deployment to blob storage is fully automated through Azure DevOps.

 What this effectively does. I only need to write a simple markdown file to draft a blog entry. When I complete the blog entry, I only need to issue one fire and forget command: `git push origin master`. Once I issue the `git push`, it triggers the build process which generates the site with my new markdown post. As soon as that is finished, the release pipeline takes the site and plops it on Azure Storage.  From there, the CDN does its thing and propagates my site globally. Having the site statically generated, coupled with the CDN that equates to very fast load times and global redundancy.
