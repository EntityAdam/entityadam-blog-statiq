In the C# language, 

In software, comparing things can be tricky.  To be able to compare your . C# primarily favors Object Oriented Programming (OOP), so out of the box C# defines equality as 'Referential Equality'. If you want to compare your  by value, you'll need to understand a few key players

# Comparing Objects

For the context of this, I'll be working with a OO representation of a playing card.

# The Gist

 Objects are only equal if they refer to the same chunk of memory. If you need to compare objects by value. In .NET if you want to compare objects by value

In the F# language where immutability is favored, referential equality makes little sense so comparing by value is default.

```
public class Card { }

public static void Main() 
{
    var card1 = new Card();
    var card2 = card1; 
    if (card1 == card2) { Console.WriteLine("Equal!"); } // card1 and card2 refer to the same object, so they are equal.
}
```
